# Obsidian Minimal Productivity Vault

A distraction-free, high-productivity Obsidian setup focused on clarity, speed, and intentional note-taking. This vault is designed to reduce noise and promote deep work, making it ideal for people who value simplicity and structure.

## File System Structure

File system folders are divided into two categories: those beginning with `_` are the general ones, while the others are created by the user. 

Each folder/file follows these rules:
1. Everything must be in lower case (except acronyms)
2. Everything must be in the same language eg. English except specific cases (such as book titles, etc...)
3. Words can be divided only by `-`
4. The following file structure can be used if needed: `algo_algorithm-definition`
	1. Where the first part before `_` is the topic
	2. The second part is the title of the file
