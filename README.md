# Obsidian Minimal Productivity Vault

A distraction-free, high-productivity Obsidian setup focused on clarity, speed, and intentional note-taking. This vault is designed to reduce noise and promote deep work, making it ideal for anyone who values simplicity and structure.

**Disclaimer**: This is not a revolutionary method that will instantly turn you into a productivity expert. It is simply a collection of practices that improved my personal workflow. They might help you too — or they might not.

## File System Structure

The vault is organized with simplicity in mind. Folders starting with `_` are system-level or general-purpose folders. Others are content-specific and user-defined.

**Naming Conventions:**
1. Use lowercase for all filenames and folders (acronyms are the exception).
2. Use a single language (typically English), unless the content requires otherwise (e.g., book titles).
3. Separate words with hyphens (`-`).
4. You may use a two-part structure for filenames: `topic_file-title`

## Note Creation Workflow

1. Create a new note using `Ctrl + N`.
2. Give the file a clear and concise title.
3. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the template selector.
4. Choose the appropriate template based on the content type.

### Note Template Structure

Each note should include the following fields:
- **Status**: Use one of the following tags to define the phase of the note:
    - `#ongoing` – The note is in an early draft or brainstorming stage.
    - `#refining` – The note is under active development or revision.
    - `#completed` – The note is finalized and not expected to change significantly.
- **Tags**: Add relevant topic tags to improve searchability and categorization.
- **Parent**: (Optional) If the note is part of a broader topic or project, specify the parent note here.
- **Updated**: This is auto-filled by the template system. If it doesn't update automatically, you can modify it manually or fix it LOL.
